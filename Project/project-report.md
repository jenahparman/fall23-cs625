Report
As always, I expect your report to include your name, CS625, date, and appropriate headings and Markdown markup for clarity and neatness. You will lose points if there are many spelling or grammatical errors.

Your report, named project-report.md, should include the following information:

a brief description of your chosen datasets (including links to the original sources of the data)
final question that you addressed
appropriately-sized image of your final chart
link to your final chart (similar to HW3, include whatever links or files are needed to view the implementation of your final chart)
idiom/mark/data/encode table for the final chart (see Markdown Code for Table)
explanation of how your final chart answers the question and how your headline fits your chart
"Final Thoughts" section that provides a commentary on the development process, including roughly how much time you spent developing your visualization and what aspects took the most time
"References" section that includes links to any examples and references that you used in completing this assignment

## Introduction
This report accompanies a visualization that compares the dietary patterns of the Blue Zones (five areas celebrated for longevity) with the average diets of their respective countries. It showcases the differences in calorie consumption from various food groups, highlighting what residents in the Blue Zones eat compared to others in their country. The aim is to provide a clear visual guide to the food choices that may play a role in the extended lifespans characteristic of these regions.

## Data Sources
### Blue Zones
The data source for the Blue Zones' diet, accessible at https://www.bluezones.com/explorations/, presents pie charts illustrating the diets of centenarians.

### National Averages
The data source for the Blue Zones' respective national average was found at
