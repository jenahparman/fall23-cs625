## Introduction
This assignment focuses on data visualization and chart implementation, with the aim of answering real-world questions using appropriate charts and design principles. I have chosen **Table 91,"Women Who Have Had a Child in the Last Year by Age"** as the dataset for this assignment. This dataset offers insights into childbirth demographics across different age groups. The following report will detail the approach, chart selection, and design principles applied to reveal significant patterns and relationships within the data.

## Question 1
### Compare the ages of women at the time of the birth of their first child between 1990-2008. For instance, is there any evidence that women in the US are waiting longer to have their first child?

## Question 2
### How does this compare to the number of women in each age group who had a child (not necessarily their first) in that year? What does this say about the age of women giving birth in the US?
