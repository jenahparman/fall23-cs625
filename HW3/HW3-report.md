## Data

### Bar Chart Data
For my bar chart, I used data from the table, "National Research & Development (R&D) Expenditures as a Percent of Gross Domestic Product by Country" (Table 800,Section 16: Science and Technolgy). This table exhibits the proportion of countries' GDP that is spent on R&D activities.\
To prepare the data for visualization, I decided to choose the most recent year in the table that had values for every country available (2008). Then, I copied these values and created a new Excel spreadsheet with two rows: one for the country names and the other for their corresponding value. Pictured below, on the left is the original table, and on the right, is the new table which I used to create the bar chart.

### Scatterplot Data
To create the scatterplot, I used two different tables: "Urban and Rural Population by State" (Table 29, Section 1: Population) and "Land and Water Area of States and Other Entities" (Table 358, Section 6: Geography and Environment)
