## Data

### Bar Chart Data
For my bar chart, I used data from the table, <a href="/HW3/Resources/12s0800.xls">"National Research & Development (R&D) Expenditures as a Percent of Gross Domestic Product by Country"</a> (Table 800, Section 16: Science and Technolgy). This table exhibits the proportion of countries' GDP that is spent on R&D activities.\
To prepare the data for visualization, I decided to choose the most recent year in the table that had values for every country available (2008). Then, I copied these values and created a new Excel spreadsheet with two rows: one for the country names and the other for their corresponding value. Below is a screenshot of the original table on the left and a screenshot of <a href="/HW3/Resources/r&d.xlsx">the new table</a> on the right (what I used to create the bar chart).

### Scatterplot Data
To create the scatterplot, I used two different tables: <a href="/HW3/Resources/12s0029.xls">"Urban and Rural Population by State"</a> (Table 29, Section 1: Population) and <a href="/HW3/Resources/12s0358.xls">"Land and Water Area of States and Other Entities"</a> (Table 358, Section 6: Geography and Environment).
"Urban and Rural Population by State" had information on populations for urban and rural areas for each state for the years 1990 and 2000. "Land and Water Area of States and Other Entities" displayed the total area, land area, and water area of each state in square miles (and square kilometers).\
I decided to create a chart that would show the relationship between rural population and land area of states. I created a new table that contained only state names, rural population, and land area.\
Below are screenshots of the original tables and the new table beneath them.
